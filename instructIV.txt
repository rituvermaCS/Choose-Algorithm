Implementation

For the implementation, we will use the house price dataset available on this kaggle page. 
Scroll down to the bottom of the page, and click on the link ‘train.csv’, 
and then click the ‘download’ blue button towards the right of the screen, to download the dataset. 
Here the file is renamed as ‘houseprice.csv’ We build a machine learning model to predict the sale price of houses based on different explanatory variables describing various aspects of these houses. 
We aim to minimize the difference between the real price and the price estimated by our model.

So we are going to use the most interesting features chosen by the Lasso regression model and check the performance of each model individually and the stack perormance. Follow along.
