How to use stacking to choose the best possible algorithms?

Every time you stumble upon a huge volume of data with thousands of features, 
you will be wondering what would be the best algorithm to get accurate predictions on this data, 
and whether to use all the features or reduce the feature space. Through this blog, 
I will take you through the steps in finding the good features through lasso regression and getting the right algorithm through a technique called stacking.
