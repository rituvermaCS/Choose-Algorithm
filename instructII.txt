Selection of the best algorithm

Stacking refers to a method of joining the machine learning models, 
similar to arranging a stack of plates at a restaurant. It combines the output of many models. 
The performance of stacking is usually close to the best model and sometimes it can outperform the prediction performance of each individual model. 

The objective is to get accurate predictions of the target variable, 
with the most relevant explanatory variables. 
We will do that by applying machine learning models such as Random Forest, Lasso regression, 
and Gradient Boosting.
Then let us stack the output of these individual models and pass it to a ridge regressor to compute the final predictions. 
Stacking utilizes the strength of each individual model by using their output as input to the final model.

We compare the performance of the stacking regressor with individual modelsâ€™ performance. 
The performance of stacking is usually close to the best model and sometimes it can outperform the prediction performance of each individual model. 
The plots at the end of this article show the performance of the individual regressors and the stacked regressor on a given data set.
