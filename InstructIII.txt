Selection of the best features

The selection of variables brings many advantages. 
The model gets simpler, less code for error handling, and reduces the chances of the fitting, 
and minimizes the introduction of bugs. The execution time of the models and memory consumption is reduced.

In machine learning terminology, 
Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) is a regression analysis method that accomplishes both variable selection and regularization in order to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the model. 
It alters the model fitting process and selects only a subset of the covariates. 
It achieves this by forcing certain coefficients to be set to zero, 
and remove these coefficients in building the model.
